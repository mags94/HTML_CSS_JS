EMBED - https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/BackSlimyDragon
Requirements:
● Create a rectangular card which is center aligned and has the text "Dropdown" and
an Icon which is a <button> on the extreme right. These need to be spaced out by
using CSS Flexbox
● The Shadow of the dropdown needs to behave in the same way as shown in the clip
above
● Align the card by using CSS Transform and not margin: auto
● Clicking on the rectangular card will open it up showing the content within -
Transitions need to be added using class names and accordingly added to the divs
using JS
● The transition for the animation should be a Cubic Bezier transition ​and should look
similar to the one above
● The content should be added in a paragraph tag and should be selectable
● Clicking on the content when the dropdown is open should not close the card.
● Clicking only on the upper part of the card should close the dropdown
